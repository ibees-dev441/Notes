It seems like the authentication method configured for the PostgreSQL server is set to "peer" authentication, which requires the system user to match the database user. Since you're trying to connect 
with the `postgres` user, you need to make sure that your system user matches that.

Here are two possible solutions:

1. **Switch to the `postgres` system user:**

   You can switch to the `postgres` system user before trying to connect to PostgreSQL. You can do this by running:

   ```
   sudo -i -u postgres
   ```

   Then, try running `psql -U postgres` again.

2. **Use password authentication:**

   If you want to connect as a different system user or if you prefer using password authentication, you can modify the PostgreSQL configuration to use password authentication.

   Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file. You can typically find it in the PostgreSQL data directory, which is often located in `/etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf`.

   Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file and change the authentication method for local connections (`host` lines) from `peer` to `md5` or `password`:

   ```
   # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
   local   all             all                                     md5
   ```

   After saving the changes, restart the PostgreSQL service:

   ```
   sudo service postgresql restart
   ```

   Now you should be able to connect using the `psql` command as you originally tried.

If `psql` is asking for a password when you're trying to connect as the `postgres` user, it means that password authentication is enabled for the `postgres` user in PostgreSQL.

During the installation of PostgreSQL, you might have set a password for the `postgres` user. If you remember setting a password during installation, try using that password.

If you don't remember setting a password during installation, you might need to reset the password for the `postgres` user. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Switch to the `postgres` system user:

   ```
   sudo -i -u postgres
   ```

2. Connect to PostgreSQL:

   ```
   psql
   ```

3. Reset the password for the `postgres` user:

   ```
   ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'new_password';
   ```

   Replace `'new_password'` with the new password you want to set.

4. Exit `psql`:

   ```
   \q
   ```

5. Exit the `postgres` user session:

   ```
   exit
   ```

Now, try connecting with `psql -U postgres` again, and use the new password you just set.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If `psql` is asking for a password when you're trying to connect as the `postgres` user, but you haven't set a password during installation, it's possible that the authentication method for 
the `postgres` user is set to `peer` in the `pg_hba.conf` file.

To resolve this, you can either switch to the `postgres` system user and connect to PostgreSQL, or modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow password authentication.

Here's how you can proceed with the second option:

1. Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file. It's typically located in the PostgreSQL data directory, often found at `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/pg_hba.conf`.

2. Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file and change the authentication method for local connections (`host` lines) from `peer` to `md5` or `password`:

   ```
   # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
   local   all             postgres                                md5
   ```

3. Save the changes to `pg_hba.conf`.

4. After saving the changes, restart the PostgreSQL service:

   ```
   sudo service postgresql restart
   ```

After making these changes, try connecting with `psql -U postgres` again. It should now prompt you for a password, and you can use the password you've set or switch to the `postgres` system user to reset the password as needed.
