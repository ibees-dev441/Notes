Clone odoo from repo, then instal postgres.

To install postgres-15:
    sudo apt install postgresql-15 postgresql-client-15 postgresql-contrib


To display all postgres versions installed:
    dpkg -l | grep postgres


To display all running instances of postgres, postgres-15 should be in running state, ignore if simple postgres is in active(exited) state.
    sudo systemctl status 'postgresql*'



After installing postgres, create a new user named 'odoo':
    sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --no-superuser --pwprompt odoo

    
Set the owner of the existing database "odoo17_db" to the user "odoo":
    sudo -u postgres psql -c 'ALTER DATABASE odoo17_db OWNER TO odoo;'

    
Grant necessary permissions to the user "odoo" on the database "odoo17_db", if needed:
    sudo -u postgres psql -c 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE odoo17_db TO odoo;'



To list psql users: (run when on hasnain user)
    sudo -u postgres psql -c '\du'


To list databases:
    psql -l



odoo.conf file settings to do:
[options]
; This is the password that allows database operations:
; admin_passwd = admin
db_host = localhost
db_port = 5432
db_name = odoo17_db
db_user = odoo
db_password = odoo17
;addons_path = /home/hasnain/Downloads/odoo/addons/
default_productivity_apps = True
http_port = 17069



To run odoo directly from CLI:
    ./odoo-bin -c /home/hasnain/Downloads/odoo/debian/odoo.conf -i base


-i base is used to initialize the database




Navigate to odoo repo where odoo-bin is located then we can run odoo in cli by this:
    ./odoo-bin -c /home/hasnain/Downloads/odoo/debian/odoo.conf
