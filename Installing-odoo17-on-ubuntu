Install Fish terminal and make it default.
Check the location of the Fish shell binary by running:
    which fish

Then change the default shell for your user by running the following command:
    chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
Now logout once to view changes.


Clone odoo from repo, then instal postgres.

To install postgres-15:
    sudo apt install postgresql-15 postgresql-client-15 postgresql-contrib


To display all postgres versions installed:
    dpkg -l | grep postgres


To display all running instances of postgres, postgres-15 should be in running state, ignore if simple postgres is in active(exited) state.
    sudo systemctl status 'postgresql*'


(Alternate method of creating user and database is given on the last; if this method dont work, try that).
After installing postgres, create a new user named 'odoo':
    sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --no-superuser --pwprompt odoo


To create a new PostgreSQL database:
    sudo -u postgres createdb -O odoo odoo17_db   (-0 is already setting odoo user the owner of this database, so below command is not necessary)

    
Set the owner of the existing database "odoo17_db" to the user "odoo":
    sudo -u postgres psql -c 'ALTER DATABASE odoo17_db OWNER TO odoo;'

    
Grant necessary permissions to the user "odoo" on the database "odoo17_db", if needed:
    sudo -u postgres psql -c 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE odoo17_db TO odoo;'



To list psql users: (run when on hasnain user)
    sudo -u postgres psql -c '\du'


To list databases:
    psql -l



odoo.conf file settings to do:
[options]
; This is the password that allows database operations:
; admin_passwd = admin
db_host = localhost
db_port = 5432
db_name = odoo17_db
db_user = odoo
db_password = odoo17
;addons_path = /home/hasnain/Downloads/odoo/addons/
default_productivity_apps = True
http_port = 17069



To run odoo directly from CLI:
    ./odoo-bin -c /home/hasnain/Downloads/odoo/debian/odoo.conf -i base


-i base is used to initialize the database




Navigate to odoo repo where odoo-bin is located then we can run odoo in cli by this:
    ./odoo-bin -c /home/hasnain/Downloads/odoo/debian/odoo.conf







First, you'll need to log in to your PostgreSQL server with a user that has the necessary privileges to create databases and users. Typically, this would be the `postgres` user or another superuser.

1. **Log in to PostgreSQL:**
       psql -U postgres
   


2. **Create a new database:**
       CREATE DATABASE odoo17_db;
  
   Replace `dbname` with the name you want to give to your database.




3. **Create a new user:**
       CREATE USER odoo WITH PASSWORD 'odoo17';
   
   Replace `username` with the desired username and `password` with the password you want to set for this user.




4. **Grant privileges to the user on the database:**
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE odoo17_db TO odoo;

   Replace `dbname` with the name of the database you created in step 2, and `username` with the name of the user you created in step 3.




5. **Configure Odoo to use the PostgreSQL database:**

   You need to edit the Odoo configuration file (`odoo.conf`) to specify the PostgreSQL database connection details.

   conf
   [options]
   db_host = localhost
   db_port = 5432
   db_user = username
   db_password = password
   db_name = dbname

   Replace `localhost` and `5432` with the appropriate host and port if your PostgreSQL server is not running on the default localhost and port. Also, replace `username`, `password`, and `dbname` with the credentials and database name you created earlier.



6. **Restart Odoo:**

   After making changes to the configuration file, restart your Odoo service for the changes to take effect.

  
   sudo service odoo-server restart
   

That's it! You've created a database and a user in PostgreSQL and connected it with Odoo.
