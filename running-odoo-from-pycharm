First open pycharm and click open and select 'odoo' folder.

Now open terminal and type:

    sudo apt install python3.11-venv
    python3.11 -m venv odoo_venv


if it doesnot activate your venv then type:
    source /path-to-venv/bin/activate


Then run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

if it gives errors, specially for python-ldap & psycopg2 then first install "python3-dev"
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev

Now re-run the installation of there two:
    pip install pip install psycopg2 python-ldap


Now you have a odoo folder and in that you have 2 folders:
odoo
odoo-venv

Just close the project and also delete the .idea folder.
Again open the pycharm, select open project, click odoo parent folder
For the environment, click existing, navigate to odoo/odoo-venv/bin/python3.11
If pycharm asks, make it default interpreter.

Now click on edit configurations, add a new python configuration for this project.
in script give full path to odoo-bin
in parameters write this:
    -c <full path to odoo.conf>
working directory should be the main odoo folder and all done. 
if you still get some package error like "pypdf2"
rerun this in venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
